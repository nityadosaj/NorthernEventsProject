            <h3>About - Canada in Crisis</h3>
            The Arctic has melted alarmingly faster than the world anticipated, and coupled with Canada's terrible historical management of its Arctic region,
            we are now seeing critical failures in all sectors. These include infrastructure, education, health and security to name a key few.
            Throw in the Arctic rapidly becoming the most valuable region in history, drawing in hordes of people, and we have a perfect storm.

            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            The Arctic Developmental Management Club (ADMC) allows Langara and her students to help shape the flow of Canadian Arctic development at a critical time. This is done predominantly through the use of student-led National Projects.
            The club's focus is on helping manage a surge in economic activity in Canada's Arctic; charting the waters between climate response,
            indigenous cultural protection, and economic development in a region where people need it more than anywhere else in Canada.
            Each member's role is up to them and their skillset, but strict club protocol is in place to guarantee success. Before any steps are taken in each project, 
            a detailed plan must be drawn out with a primary focus on the placement of constraints everywhere necessary to protect Indigenous cultures, flora, and fauna.
            Once regional integrity protection parameters are established, enhanced project growth mechanics will be utilized to initiate and/or accelerate each projects development life cycle.

            <h3>Our First National Project </h3>
            <b>The Yukon Deep Water Port Project</b>
            <p>
                It is the Dawn of an Arctic Age, one of Arctic commerce, travel, diplomacy and geopolitical tension.
                Canada, in a vital gateway, is left without an entrance to the most crucial region in history.

                The Beaufort Sea is Canada's Arctic Gateway, and King Point in Yukon 
                is the only location feasible for Canada or America to operate international shipping.
                Yet, ever since the 80's when this was first determined, we have been left port-less.
                Canada has not begun any construction of any sort in this critical location for such an important asset.
                With Canada's new flagship Arctic Offshore Patrol Vessel currently making its journey across the Arctic and no proper home for it in Canada's West, 
                it's clear to many that a solution is needed now.

                That's aside from the infinitely more important uses geared towards exporting Canadian goods, 
                especially those produced by Canada's Northern Territories.

                Canada's Arctic is estimated to hold approximately 33% of Canada's total natural wealth,
                and yet we don't even have a place for ships to dock for trading these goods.

                Yes, the conditions in the past have been difficult, but with warming waters, 
                increased regional immigration and heavy investor appeal, Canada, the time is now.
                We have to move, as a people, before those with maligned intent get there first.

                This is a National Project that has one mandatory requirement.
                Regardless of your philosophical or political persuasion, we need to operate as one. 
                Therefore, the majority Canadian values promoting green tech, a circular economy, 
                respect of Indigenous cultures and a return of nature will be forefront in this movement.

                There have been stunning attempts, some successful and others not, to create truly advanced, 
                green tech communities. We aim to draw from and surpass these outstanding efforts made by our peers.

                On the one hand, we have to move fast because global competitors are already there whether we like it or not, while we are just showing up.

                On the other hand, the Arctic is clearly an incredibly sensitive ecological region, 
                vital to the life of all things that exist on our planet. The utmost care will need to be taken in dominant conjunction with rapid project growth mechanics where applicable within project constraints.
